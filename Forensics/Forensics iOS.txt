The first thing you want to do is put the device in airplane mode
Then get the Model number and firmware version of the device

3 Methods for acquiring data from an iPhone/iPad: 
	backup acquisition
	logical acquisition
	physical acquisition

******************************************************************************************
Backup acquisition - data that has been backed up from the device onto a computer is 
	retrieved
	The main files you want from a backup acquisition are:
		*.mddata, *.mdinfo and *.mdbackup
		These files are not human readable and require a tool to view such as:
			Paraben Device Seizure
			Oxygen Forensic Suite
			Mobilyze by BlackBag Tech
			Mobile Sync Browser
			iPhone Analyzer
	Configuration files are:
		status.plist
		info.plist
		manifest.plist

iPhone Backup Extractor - Recovers lost iPhone Contacts, Calendar events, photos, SMS Messages, notes, location data, etc.

	on OSX it requires Mono:

	Once Mono is installed and iphonebackupextrator is unzipped run:
		mono iPhoneBackupExtractor.exe

iPhone Password Breaker for backups
	Elcomsoft's iPhone Password Breaker - Windows Only:
		http://www.elcomsoft.com/download.html
		This will crack the encryption passcode on Manifest.plist file




******************************************************************************************
Logical acquisition - refers to copying the active file system from the device into another file.  Allocated data from the actual device is recovered and can be analyzed later.




******************************************************************************************
Physical acquisition - block by block copy of drive.  Unfortunately, iPhone security mechanisms prevent use from being able to extract a physical image from a stock device without first gaining privileged access.

3 methods are available to perform physical acquisition on an iPhone as long as the
firmware version is below 4.x:
	Zdziarski method
	FTS's iXAM software
	jail broken device
