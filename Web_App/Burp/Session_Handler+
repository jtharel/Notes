Session Handler+ burp extension

Allows you to pull a JWT token from a server response that has it in the parameter access_token
  this can be renamed to whatever the parameter name is in the response. It will then apply it 
  to all requests that have failed auth.

When creating the session handling rule have it invoke this burp extension instead of a macro

See https://github.com/jtharel/Notes/blob/main/Web_App/Burp/Session_Handler.png file for the config.
