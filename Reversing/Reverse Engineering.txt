GPR	General Purpose Register

x86 architecture has 8 32-bit registers:
EAX
EBX
ECX	Counter in loops
EDX
EDI	Destination in string/memory operations
ESI	Source in string/memory operations
EBP	Base frame pointer
ESP	Stack pointer

Common data types:
Bytes		8 bits. Examples: AL, BL, CL
Word		16 bits. Examples: AX, BX, CX
Double Word	32 bits. Examples: EAX, EBX, ECX
Quad Word	64 bits. x86 does not have 64-bit GPRs, it can combine two registers,
			usually EDX:EAX, and treat them as 64 bit values in some 
			scenarios. Example: the RDTSC instruction write a 64-bit value
			to EDX:EAX

Square brackets [ ] indicate memory access unless it is lea
lea	evaluate the expression in [ ] not memory, put result in destination register
inc	increment
cmp	compare
push
pop
