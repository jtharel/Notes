The files in this branch that are not in the master currently are: file_autopwn.rb db_autopwn.rb
https://raw.github.com/neinwechter/metasploit-framework/autopwn-modules/modules/auxiliary/server/file_autopwn.rb
https://raw.github.com/neinwechter/metasploit-framework/autopwn-modules/plugins/db_autopwn.rb

file_autopwn.rb goes into "modules/auxiliary/server" and db_autopwn.rb goes into "plugins/".

Once you have these two files placed into the proper directories, use file_autopwn as you would any other auxiliary module (except now it will actually load most of the applicable modules) and use the command "load db_autopwn" to load the db_autopwn plugin, following which you can issue it commands as normal.
