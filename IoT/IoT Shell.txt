Example here is you get a shell through a UART or Telnet that has limited commands like just ping or ps
On a router or similar IoT device the command may run as root.

If the command is called with system(), a shell is involved,
and we can use redirection to redirect the stdin of the parent
process (i.e., the cli shell) to the child system shell process as stdin
using the < shell operator. Using the PPID environment variable, we
can obtain the PID of the parent process. With the parentâ€™s PID, we
can then access the stdin file descriptor in /proc with /proc/<parent
PID>/fd/1. Putting this all together gives us the following payload:

ping 127.0.0.1;sh</proc/${PPID}/fd/1

This should return a shell.



This example lanuches a telnet daemon on port 24. ${IFS} act as spaces
ping 127.0.0.1;/usr/sbin/telnetd${IFS}-p24${IFS}-l${IFS}/bin/sh
